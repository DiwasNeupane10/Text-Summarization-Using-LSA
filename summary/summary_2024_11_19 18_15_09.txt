Proposal
Introduction
Fitness is becoming a basic necessity for the vast majority of people.
Healthtech is a rapidly growing field that combines technology with healthcare.
It is changing how people approach fitness and health.
The project that I am proposing revolves around the above idea, where the data collected from individuals is used to offer insights and tailored exercise regimens.
I am also into fitness and a regular gymgoer.
Utilizing machine learning and data analytics, this project aims to use the healthtech’s potential to develop a solution that is customized to meet each person’s specific needs.
Potential Technologies and tools that may be used to fulfil the requirement of this project include:
Python(Programming Language)
Machine Learning Algorithms
Flask (Web Framework)
Data visualization tools
MySQL(Database)
A potential dataset https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zw8mtbm5b9/1 to be used in training the model for this project is cited below
Brown, Michel  (2024), “gym recommendation”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/zw8mtbm5b9.1

Conclusion
In summary, by utilizing the quickly developing healthtech sector, this concept presents a revolutionary strategy for managing fitness and health.
