Apples fall to the ground.
Only because we live in a world that displays stable regularities are we able to reliably shape our environment and plan our lives.
We have an intuition that these regularities are due to laws of nature, but we normally do not interrogate what these laws are and how they work in any basic metaphysical sense.
In short, we assume that, thanks to science, there is a recipe of sorts for how the laws of nature work.
You take the state of the Universe at a given moment – every single fact about every single aspect of it – and combine it with the laws of nature, then assume that these will reveal, or at least determine, the state of the Universe in the moment that comes next.
