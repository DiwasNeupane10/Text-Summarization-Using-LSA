##1.	Introduction
Text summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing that involves condensing a lengthy document into a shorter version while preserving its essential information. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a powerful technique used for text summarization that leverages the underlying semantic structure of the text.

##2.	Problem Statement
The problem we are addressing is the overwhelming amount of text data available, which makes it challenging to extract relevant information quickly. Traditional methods of reading through all the content are time-consuming and impractical, especially when dealing with large documents or multiple sources. This is where text summarization comes in as a valuable tool.
